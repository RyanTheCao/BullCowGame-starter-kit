# BullCowGame

I created my second game in Unreal Engine 4! Bull Cows is a game where you have to guess an isogram. An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters. The amount of lives you have is equal to the amount of letters that are in the word. After you make a guess, you will be reminded as to how many bulls and cows you had in the last word that you entered. A "bull" is a letter that is in the correct position. A "cow" is a letter that is in the word, but not in the right position. You win the game if you can guess the word before your lives run out!
